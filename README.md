# BeeApplicationFramework
Citizen Science Android application done for my Senior Project at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in 2017.

Android application that allows a user to log a sighting of a bumblebee, so that the data might be used by scientists for population studies and other related analyses. A lot of the code is rough and experimental as it was my first time learning the Android development workflow, but the project still serves as a fully functioning proof-of-concept.

Code by Jackson Oliva with lots of helpful mentoring from Professor Carolina Ruiz of WPI.
Images and information of bumblebees gathered from Professor Robert Gegear of WPI, Kenedi Heather, Rachel Murphy, and Devin Stevens.
