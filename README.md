# BeeApplicationFramework
Civilian Science Android application done for my Senior Project in 2017 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

A lot of the code is rough and experimental as it was my first time learning the Android development workflow, but the 
project still serves as a fully functioning proof-of-concept.

Code by Jackson Oliva with lots of helpful mentoring from Professor Carolina Ruiz of WPI.
Images and information of bumblebees gathered from Professor Robert Gigear of WPI, Kenedi Heather, Rachel Murphy, and Sam Langdon.
